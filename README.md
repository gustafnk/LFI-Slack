# Learning From Incidents in Software - Slack Community

We're at an age in software where learning from incidents is pivotal to our companies continued successes. There is an opportunity for Software Engineers to learn more about the applications of Resilience Engineering, Human Factors, and Systems Safety to their everyday work with the goal of learning how we can extract value from incidents and surprises. This Slack exists to help longtime, new, and aspiring software engineers and software engineering leaders to learn Resilience Engineering, Human Factors, Systems Safety, and distilling information within their organizations through conversation, research, and sharing of ideas.

If you're just getting started in this field we recommend reading: 
* How Complex Systems Fail, by Richard Cook
* The Field Guide to Human Error, by Sidney Dekker 
* The Error of Counting Errors, by Robert L Wears (ping @nora if you'd like a copy of this one)
* Debriefing Facilitation Guide (Etsy), by John Allspaw, Morgan Evans, Daniel Schauenberg

If you are looking for deeper information on these fields, Lorin Hochstein has put together a nice aggregation of info here: https://github.com/lorin/resilience-engineering. 

Once you’re in the workspace, the following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make your first days of the community more useful and educational:

1. Go and introduce yourself on #intros. Tell us about yourself, give a fun fact, update your profile with a photo. Put the "human" in human factors.
2. Explore the channels. If you’re looking for a place to start, we recommend:
   * #cases (share your favorite and interesting public incidents)
   * #conferences
   * #human-factors
   * There are also regional meetup channels for New York (#new-york) and San Francisco (#bayarea), feel free to create one for your region if you don't see it on the list.
   * Our channels will have people from all over the world, please check out the channel population before using @here or @channel.
   * If your favorite topic isn’t being discussed, create it. Channels are free. Announce your newly created channel on #new-channels.
3. Everyone is welcome to contribute regardless of where you are in implementation, studies, or research. If you want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool.
4. We expect that we’ll treat others with respect and kindness. We encourage debate; we ask for patience, and we remind you that you’re here to learn and that means being open to a diverse set of ideas.
5. This Slack is not a place for commercial activity (e.g. recruiting, or marketing your product/conference) except in channels dedicated to that purpose (e.g. #opportunities (job postings), #conferences, or #services) and never in an unsolicited direct message. If you are just here to sell things and not contribute and learn, the community will notice quickly. If you see commercial behavior going down, direct message any of the admins, and they will fix it.
6. Use the "Chatham House Rules" as a guideline for sharing information you find in this Slack (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”). For attribution of specific content found on this Slack, please ask the originator of that content for consent.

If you know someone who should be in here, drop one of the admins a line and they will send them an invite.

## The Admins (as of 6/1/2019)
* Nora Jones, @nora (PST) - Moderator
* Lorin Hochstein, @lorin (PST)
* Ryan Kitchens, @kitchens (PST)
* Jessica Devita @DeVita (PST) 
* Will Gallego, @Will Gallego (EST)
* Laura Maguire, @Laura Maguire (EST)
* Richard Cook, @Richard Cook (EST)

We are a small and new community right now, but we expect this to evolve and grow over time, as such, so will these guidelines.

Happy learning!
